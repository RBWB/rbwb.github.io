            <h2>Identity</h2>
Also known as King Arthur, the legendary King of Knights who governed over Britain. An “if” King Arthur who, after emerging as a king, made the Holy Lance his main armament instead of the holy sword and reigned over Britain.[1][2]

A Heroic Spirit of a “different possibility” from the normal Artoria. Although she has a human form, it is possible to say that she is no longer a Human Heroic Spirit. This version of her is a Heaven Heroic Spirit that personally returned her Holy Lance at Camlann Hill, returning it to the earth.[1][2]

While in the middle of reigning in the Holy City, the great enterprise called the Incineration of the Human Order is looming, so the “King of Knights” acted in order to save what’s most important, mankind; while she possesses the same appearance as “Goddess Rhongomyniad”, Artoria is essentially a different person.[1]

            <h2>Identity</h2>
            Also called Artoria Alter (アルトリア・オルタ, Arutoria Oruta?) and better known as Arthur Pendragon/King Arthur. In history, he/she is a different figure that may not have been known to others as possibly being the legendary King Arthur himself. Accompanied with her inversion, the holy sword Excalibur is also dyed in the attribute of evil, turning into a jet black sword. It seems that Excalibur, a sword gifted from the fairies, has the possibility of possessing both attributes of good and evil as well; there exists Vivian, the Fairy of the Lake who possesses the attribute of good, and Morgan, who exists as the antithesis to Vivian that possesses the attribute of evil. In addition, in Artoria Alter's Fate/Grand Order Interlude, Vortigern, who was criticized as the "look-alike of Vortigern, the late Vile King of ancient times" from a certain person (Servant), was a figure who usurped the throne of Britain and was the older brother of King Uther, the father of Arthur.[1]

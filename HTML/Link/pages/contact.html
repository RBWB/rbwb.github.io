            <h2>Identity</h2>
Also known as Artoria Alter (アルトリア・オルタ, Arutoria Oruta?) and better known as Arthur Pendragon/King Arthur, she was the King of Knights of the Round Table that is described in legends. In reality, a lovely girl-knight, and yet, possesses both the purity and integrity just like in the legends. She is known as a holy sword user, but the Holy Lance she possesses is actually quite powerful as well, making it possible for her to manifest as a Lancer.[2] She who holds the Holy Lance is the "King of Storms" (嵐王, Ran'Ō?), viewed as a person and leader of the Wild Hunt.[1]

... And it is also possible for her to materialize in this way as the possibility of having been violated by the curse of the Holy Grail. The spear-wielding aspect of the King of Knights that devoted herself to cruelty. Even the Holy Lance utilized at the time of the "Battle of the Hill of Camlann", known as King Arthur's last battle, possesses an omnious presence, changing into a black color.[1]
